# SSO LTI Demo

This repository contains the source code for a demonstration of Single Sign On (SSO) using Learning Tools Interoperability (LTI).

The integration endpoint for an LTI Launch in Shift iQ is platform-agnostic, therefore it can be used to integrate any application that is able to send an HTTP request. 

This particular demo shows how to implement SSO from a Microsoft ASP.NET web application. You'll notice the integration itself is a simple HTTP POST, so you can use the source code here as a reference for building an integration from any web application developed using any programming language.
